1. Font Type Selector

On the inventory page, there is a button on the top right, below the nav bar, where users can change the font via dropdown. This feature should change the font for the entire inventory page to whatever the user selected. Future iterations of this project will apply it to the rest of the website but this was done to ensure functionality for a single page. 

2. Image Click Enlarger

Also on the inventory page, when the user selects the images of the two vehicles displayed, the images themselves will become larger, occupying the center of the screen, with the rest of the page becoming slightly dim so as to emphasize the contents of the image.
